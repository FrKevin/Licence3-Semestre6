        A four bit field that specifies kind of query in this

    Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses,
    and specifies that the responding name server is an
    authority for the domain name in question section.

    Note that the contents of the answer section may have
    multiple owner names because of aliases.  The AA bit
    corresponds to the name which matches the query name, or
    the first owner name in the answer section.

        Response code - this 4 bit field is set as part of
        responses.  The values have the following interpretation:
            0               No error condition

            1               Format error - The name server was
                            unable to interpret the query.

            2               Server failure - The name server was
                            unable to process this query due to a
                            problem with the name server.

            3               Name Error - Meaningful only for
                            responses from an authoritative name
                            server, this code signifies that the
                            domain name referenced in the query does
                            not exist.

            4               Not Implemented - The name server does
                            not support the requested kind of query.

            5               Refused - The name server refuses to
                            perform the specified operation for
                            policy reasons.  For example, a name
                            server may not wish to provide the
                            information to the particular requester,
                            or a name server may not wish to perform
                            a particular operation (e.g., zone transfer) for particular data.
